Description:
REST API of a prototype for a Medical Record system

Attempt 1

Stack used:
Django
Django REST Framework
DRF nested routers
Bootstrap 5  # for demo

Tech explored:
HTMX
JWT
OAuth
aiohttp
Faker

Tools explored:
pre-commit
djlint
django-stubs  # end up not using

Archive reason:
I want to rebuild this using Django + HTMX + Tailwind + Alpine.js(optional) 
DRF is good and all but I would really like to explore HTMX
which currently doesn't really work well with DRF
since DRF returns JSON, while HTMX wants an HTML response

I might, fingers crossed, go back to this projet if this solves the problem better
But most probably, this project will stay archived
